## UI for RBQA System

This application is a user interface built using Streamlit. It provides a simple interface where users can input their questions and OpenAI API key to receive generated responses using the GPT-3.5 model. The responses can be generated based on either documentation used or directly from GPT-3.5-turbo without relying on documentation (ChatGPT). Additionally, users can provide feedback on the responses they receive. The feedback and answers will be centralized and stored in a database.
